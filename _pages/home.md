## About Me

Hi There! I recently obtained my Ph.D. in [EcoVision Lab](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/ecovision.html), [Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing Group](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/), the Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering at ETH Zurich, under the supervision of [Prof. Konrad Schindler](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/group/people/person-detail.schindler.html) and [Prof. Jan Dirk Wegner](https://www.ics.uzh.ch/en/research/research-groups/Jan-Dirk-Wegner.html).

## Research

My research interests span on 3D vision, geometry processing, and machine learning. with a specific focus on reconstructing diverse 3D vectorized representations from chaotic, unorganized data.

I am generally enthusiastic about leveraging data-driven, learning-based methodologies to address open issues in manufacturing and urban digitalization.

## Studies

I received my Master's and Bachelor's degrees from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019 and 2016, respectively. During my Master's at USTC and internship at EPFL, I developed a keen interest in machine learning and computer vision. This experience steered me towards specializing in using machine learning for vision-based tasks. Currently, at EcoVision, my focus is on vectorized and parametric reconstruction from 3D point clouds.
